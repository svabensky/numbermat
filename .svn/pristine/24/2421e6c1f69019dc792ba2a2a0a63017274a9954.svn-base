Numbermat
---------

DESCRIPTION:
Math problem generator created as a part of my bachelor thesis at the Faculty
of Informatics in Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.

Controlled via a GUI, Numbermat is able to generate from 13 types of math
problems, randomly or with user defined parameters. It provides a solution
for each problem and allows export into .tex and .pdf files.

For more information, see help inside application GUI.

SOURCE CODE:
The whole application is written in Java 7.
